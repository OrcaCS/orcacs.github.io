        <p style="text-align: right;">To see a world in a grain of sand<br>And a heaven in a wild flower,<br>Hold infinity in the palm of your hand<br>And eternity in an hour.</p>

        <p>I think the real miracle is not to walk either on water or in thin air, but to walk on earth. Every day we are engaged in a miracle which we don't even recognize: a blue sky, white clouds, green leaves, the black, curious eyes of a child—our own two eyes. All is a miracle.</p>
