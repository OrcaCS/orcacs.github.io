<h1>ambivalence</h1>
<p>the comforting space i carve out for myself in this vast world.</p>

<h1>welcome. my home is your refuge.</h1>
  
<p>i welcome you just as i welcome myself. make yourself at home.</p>

<p>it's a little bland in here right now. but bland isn't inherently bad. it will simply develop along with me on my journey.</p>
