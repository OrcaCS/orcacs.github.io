        <p style="text-align: right;">my dream world is a place<br>in which one can see both the sun and the moon;<br>in which one can concurrently bask in the polychromatic sky during a sunset and the twinkling stars during the night;<br>in which one can simultaneously feel the warmth of the sun and the cool breeze of the night.<br>all while still having the earth beneath one's feet.</p>
        <p>i hope this site captures the essence of my dreams.</p>

<p>this is the comforting space i carve out for myself in this vast world.<br>a place for a break that i hope is serene and refreshing. take as long as you need.</p>
<p>i welcome you just as i welcome myself. make yourself at home.</p>
