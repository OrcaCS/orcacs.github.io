<h1>ambivalence</h1>
<p>the comforting space i carve out for myself in this vast world.</p>

<h2>welcome. my home is your refuge.</h2>
  
<p>i welcome you just as i welcome myself. make yourself at home.</p>

<p>it's a little bland in here right now, though bland isn't inherently bad. this page will simply develop along with me on my journey of life and HTML.</p>

<p>my dream world is a place in which one can see both the sun and the moon; the polychromatic sky during a sunset and the twinkling stars in the night sky. in which one can feel the warmth of the sun and the cool breeze of the night. all while still being grounded on earth.</p>
<p>i hope this site captures the essence of my dreams.</p>
