<p style="color: teal; text-align: right;"><i>my dream world is a place<br>in which one can see both the sun and the moon;<br>in which one can concurrently bask in the polychromatic sky during a sunset and the twinkling stars during the night;<br>in which one can simultaneously feel the warmth of the sun and the cool breeze of the night.<br>all while still having the earth beneath one's feet.</i></p>
<p style="color: teal;"><i>i hope this site captures the essence of my dreams.</i></p>

<p style="color: teal;">this is the comforting space i carve out for myself in this vast world.<br>a place for a break that i hope is serene and refreshing. take as long as you need.</p>
<p style="color: teal;">i welcome you just as i welcome myself. make yourself at home.</p>

<br>

<p style="color: teal; font-size: 10px;">it's a little basic in here right now, though basic isn't inherently bad. this page will simply develop along with me on my journey of life and HTML learning.</p>

<p style="color: teal; font-size: 180x;">may we cross paths somewhere, sometime in a promising and limitless world.</p>
